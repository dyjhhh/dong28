This program simulates a popular type of book in which the reader encounters specific choices while reading through the story. The reader must decide on a particular choice, then flip to the page coresponding to that choice to continue the adventure. The number of choices possible for any decisions is limited to three. In the first part of this program, the outout is the oage number and then the three choices, all displayed in hexadecimal numbers. The code use the array form of the book to allow a player to play the game. The game implements a finite state machinefor which the internal state is the current page being read by the player, and the transitions occur in response to the player's choice. Plays begin at page 0, and prnt a message indicating that the game has started. Then it will print thr string for the player's current page. If the current page has no valid choice, the game is over, program will print a termination message and halt. If valid choices are available, print a prompt for player input. Then wait for the player to press a key using GETC and echo the key to the screen using PRINT CHAR, followed by two ASCII linefeeds (0xA). The player's input is valid if the key pressed was between 1 and 3 and the corresponding choice (from the array) for the current page is not -1. If the player's input is not valid, print an error message and go back to re-print the string for the current page. If the player's input is valid, change the current page to the corresponding choice, and go back to print the string for the new page.
