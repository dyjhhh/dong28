This program implements the logic for a codebreaking game. A code sequence of four numbers from 1 to 8 is first chosen at random. The player guesses a sequence of four numbers and is given feedback on each guess. This feedback includes the number of values that appear in the same place in the solution code (these we call perfect matches), the number of values less than their corresponding number in the solution code , and the number of values greater than the their corresponding number in the solution code. If the player manages to guess the correct sequence in ten or fewer guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.
