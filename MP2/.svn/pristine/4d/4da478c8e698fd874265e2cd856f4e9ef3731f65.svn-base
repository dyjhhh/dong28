This program simulates a popular type of book in which the reader encounters specific choices while reading through the story. The reader must decide on a particular choice, then flip to the page coresponding to that choice to continue the adventure. The number of choices possible for any decisions is limited to three. In the first part of this program, the outout is the oage number and then the three choices, all displayed in hexadecimal numbers.
